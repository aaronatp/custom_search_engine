Case Studies in District GovernanceEdited by Donald R. McAdams and Dan  Katzir
The Redesign of Urban School Systems provides a uniquely valuable resource for anyone involved in preparing education leaders for the political and practical realities of district-based school reform.Edited by two leading experts in education reform, this absorbing volume brings together twelve teaching cases on urban school governance developed specifically for training school boards and district leaders. The cases illustrate major shifts in district-wide reform, from traditional, hierarchical, compliance-driven bureaucracies to high-performing, student-centered systems. Richly detailed, fast-paced, and incisive, they describe real-life situations in which district leaders and school boards grapple with district wide reform efforts.

The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) Middle Grades Redesign Initiative engages educators, school leaders, students, families, central departments, and community partners to redesign the middle grades experience so that each and every student has access to world-class 21st century teaching and learning and equitable, personalized support throughout their school day, school year, and beyond in order to acquire the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of SFUSD's Graduate Profile.
Remove existing institutional barriers for all students to a universal set of learning opportunities, regardless of race, gender, language, or background, and
Provide the professional collaboration and development opportunities for teachers to reimagine and redesign teaching and learning across all subject areas so that students will accelerate and exercise choice in a rigorous, relevant, and interdisciplinary education that prepares them for high school, college, and career in the 21st century.
Realizing Vision 2025 requires redesigning the middle grades
Feature article by Superintendent Vincent Matthews in the SF Examiner (Feb. 2018)
Change in big organizations such as ours starts with a challenge and an idea — a vision of what could happen to create better learning experiences for our students. As you know, we have a vision. But a vision is just the start. Change happens when we translate our vision into a new reality.
I’ve written here before about our graduate profile, the central part of our Vision 2025 plan that describes the skills and dispositions we aspire to cultivate in all of our graduates. To realize our vision and the graduate profile, we must start in preschool and move all the way through a student’s academic career.
That’s why a group of middle grades (sixth through eighth grade) principals and central administrators in charge of instruction, technology and innovation came together to begin a major undertaking — the Middle Grades Redesign. Anchored around the changes required to realize our vision, a group of principals and educators identified needs and challenges and began designing what the middle grade years could look like.
They studied examples from around the country and imagined what their own teaching and classroom environments might look like.
This group now has some proposals they will be sharing with other educators, district parents and community members to gather feedback, make refinements and resolve potential challenges. Some of these ideas have big implications — but don’t worry, we will get a lot of feedback first and aim to try these out with a few volunteer school communities before going bigger.
Here are some of the key ideas developed through the middle grades redesign process so far:
Currently, each SFUSD middle school organizes its day a little bit differently. Most have six, sometimes seven, periods per day and two semesters. This means students — especially English learners and students with learning challenges — have limited access to elective courses because there simply isn’t enough time in the day the way the classes are currently divided.  It also means that students usually move between classes in 50-minute time blocks, often resulting in a lack of time for deep inquiry and hands-on learning.
In the proposed redesign, students will take eight courses per week in a block schedule, which  means that instead of 50-minute periods, classes meet longer on alternate days. Additionally, the year will be divided into trimesters, with longer periods of time for deeper learning. This new schedule will permit all students to participate in and benefit from an expanded range of classes and programs.
UNIVERSAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR ALL MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS
There will be a consistent offering of core courses (language arts, math, history, science, P.E.) and exploratory courses (Computer Science, Health, Visual and Performing Arts, World Language). Additionally, instead of only a limited number English proficient students and students with disabilities participating in what are called “acceleration” courses, all students will have acceleration opportunities that are based on their needs and interests. For students who are at or above grade level in math and English, there will be an opportunity to go deeper by tackling more complex math problems or reading and writing more in a variety of genres.
Teachers are continuously learning and collaborating with their colleagues. Right now, each school plans its own schedule to determine when teachers have time to meet. As part of ensuring teachers get time to build their professional capacity, the redesign proposal also includes a weekly afternoon early release for all SFUSD schools. The aligned professional learning time will enable more educators to collaborate and design together on interdisciplinary projects and lessons.

In 2015 the Kansas State Department of Education traveled across Kansas to ask families, businesses, community partners, and educators what they wanted to see in successful high school graduates, and what role K-12 schools should play in developing youth? From this tour KSDE gathered thousands of responses to help create the Kansas Can School Redesign model. Kansas Redesign focuses on four principles: Student success skills, community partnerships, real world application, and personalized learning. Starting with just seven school districts and 14 schools, redesign has grown to over 190 schools in 71 districts doing incredible work. The journey has not been easy, but schools will tell you it has been worth it. Join us as we share six of these of compelling redesign stories. Districts featured in the series include Dighton, Leavenworth, Beloit, Wellington, Liberal, and Coffeyville.
Beloitâs redesign takes STEM education to a whole new level with drones, robotics, and a student run garden. A strong focus on studentâs social-emotional learning has also improved student moral, attendance, and retention.
Coffeyvilleâs redesign journey focuses on a district wide approach to social-emotional learning, project-based learning, and service learning. Highlighted in their story is a long-standing kindergarten class embedded in the local senior citizen center.
Leavenworth redesign starts at David Brewer Elementary school with a strong emphasis in social-emotional learning. Two highlighted in their story is their adult mentoring program and service-learning projects that help students give back to the community.
Dightonâs redesign journey is centered on project-based learning, flexible scheduling, and work study programs. Highlighted in their story is a unique residential maintenance class for students to learn how to fix common home repair/maintenance needs.
Liberalâs redesign efforts at the elementary level include MiTEE Monday, a therapy dog names Bailey, and unique classes in computer coding. At the High school, Flex mod scheduling has allowed students to take more local college classes and work internships (work studies) while in school.
Wellingtonâs redesign focuses heavily on project-based learning and personalized learning. These two focuses have given students more freedom and the staff a boost in creativity.

Transforming Accountability Through Continuous Improvement
After years of planning and development, CPS has introduced a new system for understanding the daily learning experiences of our students. The Continuous Improvement and Data Transparency policy transforms the District’s accountability system by focusing on the holistic development of students. It fosters a collaborative relationship between the District, schools, and communities by providing equitable resources and supporting each school’s unique priorities.
The District's commitment to continuous improvement is about creating better learning environments that support every student's growth, well-being, and academic success. Our approach focuses on key principles that guide how we support our students and schools every day.
CPS is dedicated to addressing every aspect of a student's development, including academic, social, emotional, and well-being needs. This means that schools aim to create environments where students feel safe, supported, and inspired to reach their full potential.
CPS is committed to ensuring that every student has access to the resources and support they need, especially those in historically underserved communities. This approach helps close opportunity gaps and ensures all students can succeed.
CPS believes in being open and transparent about how schools are performing. By using data to understand what's working and where improvements are needed, the District and schools can better support students and make informed changes.
CPS values collaboration between schools, families, and the community. By working together, schools aim to create inclusive and welcoming environments where every student, parent, and teacher feels valued and inolved.
Beginning in 2019, CPS embarked on an ambitious process to redesign the District's accountability system. In April 2023, CPS adopted a new policy for evaluating school performance, built from the ground up using stakeholder feedback, advice, and participation.
Throughout this initiative, the District engaged over 20,000 stakeholders and formed a diverse advisory group to reimagine our approach to accountability. This new approach replaces the School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP), ends school rankings from CPS, and will promote equity and excellence in our schools.
Accountability is the idea of holding schools and districts responsible for student learning. Systems that support accountability provide information on school performance and quality.
The Accountability Redesign initiative resulted in the development of a new policy and system for analyzing school practices and student outcomes. This new system, known as Continuous Improvement and Data Transparency, shifts focus away from punitive measurements of school quality to a holistic understanding of student learning and wellbeing. This means focusing not only on academic success but also fostering an environment that supports students’ growth and wellbeing. It replaces the School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP) and improves on many aspects of its predecessor by being built from the ground up using stakeholder feedback, advice and participation.
Our new approach to accountability focuses on working with schools to address challenges, not penalizing them. Watch our video to learn more about how CIDT is changing the District's system of accountability.
As part of the implementation process for CIDT, we’ve made major updates to our school profiles to support the District's new approach to understanding student the daily learning experiences of students. As you browse, you'll notice changes to data and information captured about each school. In addition to the information you’re used to seeing, profiles will now begin to include expanded data about how the District and schools support the whole child.
The Continuous Improvement and Data Transparency Policy (CIDT) sets out a systematic means for measuring a school’s performance and identifying schools in need of support. It replaces the School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP) and improves on many aspects of its predecessor.
As part of the accountability redesign process, CPS engaged more than 20,000 stakeholders to reimagine our approach to accountability.
During the development stage of the process, CPS set out to redefine and redesign the District’s existing accountability system.
As part of passing the new CIDT policy in April 2023, the Board of Education and the District laid out a timeline for fully implementing the new policy.
In 2019, the District decided to redesign its school accountability system to be more equitable, stakeholder-driven, and better reflect the realities of CPS' many great schools.
CPS is committed to measuring student and school performance, and the district's previous school accountability system, School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP), was a national exemplar about how to use data to inform school communities. However, we heard feedback from our community that SQRP can be improved upon to better account for systemic inequities and optimized to support critical aspects of the district's work. In response, the district partnered with our communities to develop a new system to better serve school communities and the district.
In accordance with CPS’ Core Values of Equity, Integrity, and Transparency, the District assembled a diverse group of stakeholders and experts into an Accountability Redesign Advisory Group. The Advisory Group was tasked with learning about accountability best practices, hearing potential solutions to key questions about accountability design, processing stakeholder feedback, and synthesizing all of this information into clear recommendations for the District.
The accountability redesign work that took place between 2019 and 2023 engaged tens of thousands of stakeholders, consulted with education experts, and ultimately reimagined the District’s approach to accountability.
The Continuous Improvement and Data Transparency policy that has replaced SQRP improves on many aspects of its predecessor by being built from the ground up using stakeholder feedback, advice, and participation.
As a part of passing the new CIDT policy in April of 2023, the Board of Education and the District laid out a timeline for fully implementing the new policy. This implementation process will continue to engage stakeholders’ voices, build alignment and cohesion in the district, and create learning materials to maintain transparency and guide the transition from SQRP to CIDT.
