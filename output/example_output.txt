Case Studies in District GovernanceEdited by Donald R. McAdams and Dan  Katzir
The Redesign of Urban School Systems provides a uniquely valuable resource for anyone involved in preparing education leaders for the political and practical realities of district-based school reform.Edited by two leading experts in education reform, this absorbing volume brings together twelve teaching cases on urban school governance developed specifically for training school boards and district leaders. The cases illustrate major shifts in district-wide reform, from traditional, hierarchical, compliance-driven bureaucracies to high-performing, student-centered systems. Richly detailed, fast-paced, and incisive, they describe real-life situations in which district leaders and school boards grapple with district wide reform efforts.

McAdams has been a research professor at the University of Houston and an independent quality management consultant with national and international clients in manufacturing, mining, travel, financial services, health care, and education. Previously, he served as executive vice president of the American Productivity and Quality Center, president of the Texas Independent College Fund, president of Southwestern Adventist College, and professor of history at Andrews University. McAdams has served on the boards of a major hospital, two private schools, and many academic and civic organizations, as well as on national commissions and task forces focused on urban school district governance and redesign. He has published numerous articles in academic and trade journals and opinion editorials in newspapers, and is the author of Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools . . . and Winning! Lessons from Houston (Teachers College Press, 2000), and What School Boards Can Do: Reform Governance for Urban Schools (Teachers College Press, 2006). McAdams received a PhD in British history from Duke University.Dan Katzir is a senior adviser to The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation. From 1999 to 2010, he served as the founding managing director of the foundation’s education work. During that time, he oversaw the growth of the foundation’s education work to nearly half a billion dollars in grant commitments. Katzir also was instrumental in developing and launching the foundation’s four national flagship initiatives: The Broad Prize, the nation’s largest annual education award; The Broad Institute for School Boards, a national training and support program for urban school district governance teams; and The Broad Superintendents Academy and The Broad Residency, two management development programs designed to train executives from education and other sectors as senior managers and CEOs in the nation’s largest and most challenged school systems. Early in his career, Katzir was a management consultant with Bain & Company and then served as chief operating officer for Teach For America. He went on to serve as the first executive director of the UCLA School Management Program, a joint venture of UCLA’s Graduate School of Education and Anderson School of Management, and as the founding regional director of Sylvan Learning Systems in Los Angeles.

"The Redesign of Urban School Systems: Case Studies in District Governance is effective and engaging. The cases are data rich, and consistently raise compelling issues that will be of interest not just to school board members, but also to scholars and those seeking to learn more about the ways that districts succeed and fail."  — Jeffrey Brooks, Teachers College Record

The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) Middle Grades Redesign Initiative engages educators, school leaders, students, families, central departments, and community partners to redesign the middle grades experience so that each and every student has access to world-class 21st century teaching and learning and equitable, personalized support throughout their school day, school year, and beyond in order to acquire the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of SFUSD's Graduate Profile.
Remove existing institutional barriers for all students to a universal set of learning opportunities, regardless of race, gender, language, or background, and
Provide the professional collaboration and development opportunities for teachers to reimagine and redesign teaching and learning across all subject areas so that students will accelerate and exercise choice in a rigorous, relevant, and interdisciplinary education that prepares them for high school, college, and career in the 21st century.
Realizing Vision 2025 requires redesigning the middle grades
Feature article by Superintendent Vincent Matthews in the SF Examiner (Feb. 2018)
Change in big organizations such as ours starts with a challenge and an idea — a vision of what could happen to create better learning experiences for our students. As you know, we have a vision. But a vision is just the start. Change happens when we translate our vision into a new reality.
I’ve written here before about our graduate profile, the central part of our Vision 2025 plan that describes the skills and dispositions we aspire to cultivate in all of our graduates. To realize our vision and the graduate profile, we must start in preschool and move all the way through a student’s academic career.
That’s why a group of middle grades (sixth through eighth grade) principals and central administrators in charge of instruction, technology and innovation came together to begin a major undertaking — the Middle Grades Redesign. Anchored around the changes required to realize our vision, a group of principals and educators identified needs and challenges and began designing what the middle grade years could look like.
They studied examples from around the country and imagined what their own teaching and classroom environments might look like.
This group now has some proposals they will be sharing with other educators, district parents and community members to gather feedback, make refinements and resolve potential challenges. Some of these ideas have big implications — but don’t worry, we will get a lot of feedback first and aim to try these out with a few volunteer school communities before going bigger.
Here are some of the key ideas developed through the middle grades redesign process so far:
Currently, each SFUSD middle school organizes its day a little bit differently. Most have six, sometimes seven, periods per day and two semesters. This means students — especially English learners and students with learning challenges — have limited access to elective courses because there simply isn’t enough time in the day the way the classes are currently divided.  It also means that students usually move between classes in 50-minute time blocks, often resulting in a lack of time for deep inquiry and hands-on learning.
In the proposed redesign, students will take eight courses per week in a block schedule, which  means that instead of 50-minute periods, classes meet longer on alternate days. Additionally, the year will be divided into trimesters, with longer periods of time for deeper learning. This new schedule will permit all students to participate in and benefit from an expanded range of classes and programs.
UNIVERSAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR ALL MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS
There will be a consistent offering of core courses (language arts, math, history, science, P.E.) and exploratory courses (Computer Science, Health, Visual and Performing Arts, World Language). Additionally, instead of only a limited number English proficient students and students with disabilities participating in what are called “acceleration” courses, all students will have acceleration opportunities that are based on their needs and interests. For students who are at or above grade level in math and English, there will be an opportunity to go deeper by tackling more complex math problems or reading and writing more in a variety of genres.
Teachers are continuously learning and collaborating with their colleagues. Right now, each school plans its own schedule to determine when teachers have time to meet. As part of ensuring teachers get time to build their professional capacity, the redesign proposal also includes a weekly afternoon early release for all SFUSD schools. The aligned professional learning time will enable more educators to collaborate and design together on interdisciplinary projects and lessons.
